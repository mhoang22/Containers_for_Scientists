We were trying to call the `run_analysis.sh` script but the isolation of containers that makes them useful also means that we didn't have this script on our container.\n\nSo how do we get files we need onto a container we are using?\n\nThere are a few options:\n\n- We could run our container and within that we could download the files we need from online! For example we could `git clone` files from a repository or otherwise `wget` or `curl` files that are stored online somewhere.  \n- We could `COPY` a file on to the docker image when we are building it (more on this next chapter). But we want to be careful with this strategy for two reasons:\n     - We don't want our image to be too big. So, this strategy can be fine if the file is small and something we know will always be needed for any use of the container.  \n     - We DEFINITELY need to avoid ever having protected data on images that are shared. NEVER put protected data on images that we are sharing -- more on this later too.  \n- Lastly we can add a `volume` of files that are local to our computer. We'll dive into this strategy in this chapter. This will probably be the most common way you'll use to get access to files on your container.  \n\nWhat is a volume? A volume is a folder, likely from your computer, that can be accessed by your container.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](resources/images/figure//1T5Lfei2UVou9b0qaUCrWXmkcIwAao-UcN4pHMPEE4CY_g30a4ed49e59_0_1097.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nI think of volumes like portals:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/4sDxn0FxPG2SN2iF9E\" width=\"480\" height=\"269\" style=\"\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/tide-seriously-disappointed-judging-you-4sDxn0FxPG2SN2iF9E\">via GIPHY</a></p>\n\nThe portal/volume can be opened when you `RUN` the container. And when you stop and delete the container the portal is no longer there. But its a way that your container can access and modify files on your computer for the time being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Activity Instructions {.panelset}\n\n### Docker\n\nOur container is separate from our computer so if we want to use a file from our computer we have to attach it using a \"volume\".\n\n##### Step 1: Let’s add our containers-for-scientists-sandbox files\n\nLet's point a volume to our workshop files so we have them on our container.\n\nWe can specify a particular file path on our computer or give it `$PWD`. Then optionally we can give a `:` and a file path where we'd like it to be stored on the container. Otherwise it will be stored at the absolute top of the container. Note that `$PWD` is a special environment variable that stores the absolute path of the current working directory. You will need to be in the `containers-for-scientists-sandbox-main` for this to work.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](resources/images/figure//1T5Lfei2UVou9b0qaUCrWXmkcIwAao-UcN4pHMPEE4CY_g30a4ed49e59_0_1128.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Now we can run:\n```\ndocker run -v $PWD:/home cansav09/practice-image:1\n```\nIf you have a windows machine you may have to run this variant instead.
