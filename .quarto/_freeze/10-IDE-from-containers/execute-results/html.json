So you know how you can access your files from a container. But perhaps you don't want to work completely from command line and would like a Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to work from. \n\nIf you use RStudio or Jupyter notebooks, you will really like this chapter. \n\nDocker has a `port` option that allows you to work from the container with an IDE if the image you are using has it installed. \n\nHere's an example of RStudio running from a container and being seen from a Docker port: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](resources/images/figure//1T5Lfei2UVou9b0qaUCrWXmkcIwAao-UcN4pHMPEE4CY_g2effc5b673e_0_626.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHere's an example of Jupyter running from a container and being seen from a Docker port: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](resources/images/figure//1T5Lfei2UVou9b0qaUCrWXmkcIwAao-UcN4pHMPEE4CY_g30a80783034_1_39.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIf this is of interest to you, we'll walk you through how to do this in this chapter!\n\n## Activity Instructions {.panelset}\n\n### Jupyter analysis IDE example:\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Navigate to the folder that you would like to work in.   \n \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Use this command:   \n\n```\ndocker run --rm -v $PWD:/home/jovyan/work -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes -p 8888:8888 jhudsl/reproducible-python\n```\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Copy and paste the output URL to your favorite browser. \n\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Develop to your heart's content as you normally would with Jupyter notebooks.   \n\nIf you need packages that aren't here, now you know how to take the Dockerfile and modify it. [Here's the dockerfile and associated GitHub repo for this image](https://github.com/jhudsl/reproducible-python-example/tree/main/docker).\n\n\n### RStudio analysis IDE example:\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Navigate to the folder that you would like to work in.   \n  \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Use this command but replace the `password` part with your own password.   \n\n```\ndocker run -it -v $PWD:/home/rstudio -e PASSWORD=password -p 8787:8787 jhudsl/reproducible-r\n```\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Then copy and paste `localhost:8787` in your internet browser.  \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> On this page, your username will be `rstudio` and your password will be whatever you specified.   \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Develop to your heart's content in this RStudio IDE normally would.  \n  \nIf you need packages that aren't here, now you know how to take the Dockerfile and modify it.
