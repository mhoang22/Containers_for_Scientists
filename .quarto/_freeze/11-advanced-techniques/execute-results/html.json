But what if you have a ton of arguments to specify and things that you can't do from a single command? Enter docker compose. This allows you to get very fancy with your docker containers and specify a bunch of things in your yaml file. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](resources/images/figure//1T5Lfei2UVou9b0qaUCrWXmkcIwAao-UcN4pHMPEE4CY_g2effc5b673e_0_655.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## What's Kubernetes\n\n[Kubernetes is a way you can use a bunch of containers at once](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/). It's mostly not needed for scientific analyses but now you know about it. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](resources/images/figure//1T5Lfei2UVou9b0qaUCrWXmkcIwAao-UcN4pHMPEE4CY_g2effc5b673e_0_660.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::",
